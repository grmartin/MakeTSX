# MakeTSX

This is a tool intended to generate custom [RoyalTS](https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/win/features) and [RoyalTS|X](https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/mac/features) documents with a common shell environment for per-project use.

I consider all **my** code here to be Public Domain, libraries used by this tool may not share that licensing model. Those dependencies can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

This Project has been tested ONLY on macOS, but may work on Windows as well.
